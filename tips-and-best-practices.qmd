# Tips & Best Practices

## Offline Workflows

### Planning for Offline Work

- Download maps before heading to the field
- Test offline functionality in the office
- Prepare backup power sources
- Plan data collection routes efficiently

### Optimizing Offline Performance

- Use appropriate map scales
- Limit offline area size
- Choose efficient basemaps
- Monitor storage usage

### Offline Data Management

- Sync regularly when connection is available
- Keep local storage organized
- Backup critical data
- Monitor sync status

## Battery Management

### Device Settings

- Reduce screen brightness
- Disable unnecessary apps
